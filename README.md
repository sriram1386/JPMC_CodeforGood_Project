This project was built during the JPMC Code for Good Hackathon 2025 in collaboration with the Reaching Roots Foundation, an NGO working to transform rural communities in Bhopal, Madhya Pradesh.

We developed a data dashboard to digitize their offline-first workflows â€” from village identification and needs assessment to tracking machine rentals and supporting Village Level Entrepreneurs (VLEs).

The goal is to replace manual record-keeping with a more efficient and reliable system that improves decision-making, boosts transparency, and empowers local communities. Ultimately, this solution aims to strengthen rural entrepreneurship, sustainable agriculture, and climate resilience.
